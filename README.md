# Customer Purchase Prediction — SVM Classifier

This project builds a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict customer purchasing behavior based on historical features. It explores kernel selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation using a real-world dataset.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Can we accurately predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on behavioral and demographic features?

## 🧠 Approach

- Preprocessed and standardized features for optimal SVM performance
- Tuned hyperparameters (`C`, `gamma`, `kernel`) using `GridSearchCV`
- Compared linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels
- Selected RBF kernel with highest accuracy and F1-score

## 📊 Results

- **Best Model:** RBF SVM  
- **Accuracy:** 92.5%  
- **F1-score:** 0.90  
- **Support Vector Analysis:** Explored model complexity across `C` values  
- **Visualizations:** Decision boundaries, confusion matrix, and class separation plots

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Google Colab
